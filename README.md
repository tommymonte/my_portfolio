# Hello! I'm Tommaso 👋  
**Embedded & Firmware Engineer | Virtual Platforms | QEMU | Automotive & Security**

Welcome to my personal portfolio.  
I am a final-year Master’s student in **Computer Engineering (Embedded Systems)** at **Politecnico di Torino**, with a strong focus on **embedded firmware development, microcontroller architectures, virtual platforms, and system-level debugging**.

I am particularly interested in **automotive-grade embedded systems, hardware/software co-design, and secure platforms**, and I enjoy working close to the hardware while maintaining a strong system-level view.
